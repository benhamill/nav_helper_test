# Nav Helper!

This is a test of an idea to make setting the active class on navigation tabs
easier and clearer.


## Check It Out

Each branch in this repo is trying something different. Most start from the
basis that master provides: A few controllers, some nested, a nav bar and a
sub-nav bar (only on some pages). Hopefully, each branch will make the right
tabs active for the right pages.


## Helping Out

If this solution can be made robust enough, I'd like to extract it into a gem.
But it's not as nice to use as I'd like. If you have any ideas, I'd love to hear
them. Open an Issue here to talk about it, or hit me up [over
